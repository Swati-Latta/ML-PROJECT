# ML-PROJECT
TITANIC-DATASET

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.


One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

This Kaggle Getting Started Competition provides an ideal starting place for people who may not have a lot of experience in data science and machine learning.

# **Goal for this Project:**
My goal was to answer critical questions such as who survived the tragedy and what factors contributed to survival.

# **Analysis**

1. **Passenger Demographics:** Analyze the demographic aspects of the passengers, such as age, gender, class, and port of embarkation. Explore how these factors relate to survival rates.

2. **Survival Analysis:** Investigate the survival rate among passengers based on various factors like class, age, gender, family size, and fare paid. Identify patterns or trends that may indicate higher chances of survival.

3. **Feature Importance:** Utilize machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to determine the importance of different features in predicting survival. Highlight which factors played a crucial role in determining survival outcomes.

    1. Started with downloading the data from Kaggle website.
    
    2. Load the dta into Python Jyputer Notebook for further analysis. 
    
    3. Did the Data cleaning(EDA) part with the help of Pandas and NumPy.
    
    4. Performed in depth analysis of the data using charts and Created different charts from the data for better understanding of the data.

1. **Gender Impact:** The analysis may have revealed that gender played a significant role in survival. Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to male passengers. This highlights the "women and children first" policy followed during the Titanic disaster.

2. **Class Disparities:** Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had a better chance of survival compared to those in lower classes (2nd and 3rd class). This reflects the preferential treatment given to first-class passengers during evacuation.

3. **Age and Survival:** The survival rate might have varied across different age groups. Children and elderly passengers might have had higher survival rates than young adults.

4. **Family Size:** Analyzing family size might have shown that passengers with larger families faced challenges during evacuation, impacting their survival chances.

## The aim of the Project is to:

1. **Expand to Other Ship Disasters:** Consider extending the project to analyze data from other historical ship disasters, comparing survival patterns and factors across different events.

2. **Write a Blog Post:** Summarize your project findings and share them in a blog post, reaching a wider audience and inviting discussions and feedback.
